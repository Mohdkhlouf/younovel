    <p>
    By developing technological skills in individuals, we locally and globally employ highly talented youth. Locally, we achieve this by enhancing research and development capabilities and establishing startups in various fields, such as doctor-programmers in health research and development, pharmacist-programmers in pharmaceuticals, and mechanical engineer-programmers in automotive research, among others. Globally, we employ youth after raising their competencies to international standards in companies in Finland, Europe, and America. Consequently, Jordan, Arab countries, and any other nation become technology exporters.
